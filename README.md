# Data Science Practicum 2020

This is a proposal for a Data Science course to be taught at the Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, in the fall semester 2020/2021.  

I expect to give 12 lectures, each focused on one dataset (typically from [kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com)) and one data science technique. The emphasis should be on coding and practising data science skills, not the theoretical background.

## Lectures 

  1. **Linear regression** [[data]], git and GitHub
  1. **Logistic regression** [[data]], splitting data into train, validation and testing sets
  1. **Unsupervised methods** [[data]], visualizations
  1. **Trees and forests**
  1. **XGBoost & friends**
  1. **Review**
  1. **TF, Keras, neural networks**
  1. **Fine-tuning, transfer learning**
  1. **Classification of images**
  1. **Neural networks applied to natural language processing**
  1. **Neural networks applied to tabular data**
  1. **Collaborative filtering**
